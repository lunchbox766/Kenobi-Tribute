          <p> Obi Wan Kenobi was one of the jedi masters during the end days of the republic.
            He was known as a master of the lightsaber discipline Soresu, a defensive form. However,
            before the first invasion of Naboo, he favored a more acrobatic and aggressive form
            called Ataru. Despite falling in love with the mandolorian senator, the duchess Satine,
            he stayed true to the jedi code.
